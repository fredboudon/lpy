=======
L-Py
=======

L-systems were conceived as a mathematical framework for modeling growth of plants. 
L-Py is a simulation software that mixes L-systems construction with the Python high-level modeling language. 

In addition to this software module, an integrated visual development environment has been developed that facilitates the creation of plant models.
In particular, easy to use optimization tools have been integrated. 
Thanks to Python and its modular approach, this framework makes it possible to integrate a variety of tools defined in different modeling context, in particular tools from the OpenAlea platform. Additionally, it can be integrated as a simple growth simulation module 
into more complex computational pipelines.

**L-Py** is released under a **CeCILL** license, which is compatible to the **GNU GPL**.

=============
Installation
=============


``L-Py`` distribution is based on the ``conda`` software environment management system.
To install conda, you may refer to its installation page: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/

To install L-Py, you need to create an environment (named for instance lpy) :

.. code-block:: bash

        >>> conda create -n lpy openalea.lpy -c fredboudon -c conda-forge

The package ``openalea.lpy`` is retrieved from the ``fredboudon`` channel (developement) and its dependencies will be taken from ``conda-forge`` channel.

Then, you need to activate the L-Py environment

.. code-block:: bash

        >>> conda activate lpy

And then run L-Py

.. code-block:: bash

        >>> lpy

=============
Documentation
=============

Documentation is available at `<http://lpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_


A previous version of the documentation was also available on  `OpenAlea website <http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=packages:vplants:lpy:main>`_

Help and Support
----------------

Please open an **Issue** if you need support or you run into any error (Installation, Runtime, etc.).
We'll try to resolve it as soon as possible.
